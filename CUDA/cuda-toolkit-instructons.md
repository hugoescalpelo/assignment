# CUDA Toolkit Instructions

Cuda Toolkit provides an environment to run and develop GPU-accelerated applications.

For the "data-visualization" test app, CodeProject.AI server will be used through Docker Engine for computer vision apps. In order to use an nVidia GPU, CUDA Toolkit has to be installed.

This requires a nVidia GPU capable PC.

## Instructions

Test if nVidia GPU is enabled. Run the following command.
```
nvidia-smi
```
If nVidia hardware is installed, you will see something similar to the following:
